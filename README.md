# RFM-Customer-Segmentation-Analysis

## Project Overview

This project applies RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis to segment customers based on purchasing behavior.
The goal is to identify high-value customers, at-risk customers, and growth opportunities, then translate insights into actionable marketing strategies.

This analysis is commonly used in CRM, retention marketing, and customer analytics.

## Objectives

Segment customers using RFM scoring

Identify key customer groups (Champions, At Risk, Lost, Potential Loyalists, etc.)

Understand behavioral patterns across segments

Propose data-driven marketing actions to improve retention and revenue

## Methodology

Recency – How recently a customer made a purchase

Frequency – How often they purchased

Monetary – How much they spent

### Steps:

Calculate R, F, M metrics for each customer

Assign scores (1–5) using quantiles

Combine scores into RFM segments

Analyze segment distribution and business impact
